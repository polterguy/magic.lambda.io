## License

Magic is licensed as Affero GPL. This means that you can only use it to create Open Source solutions.
If this is a problem, you can contact at thomas@gaiasoul.com me to negotiate a proprietary license if
you want to use the framework to build closed source code. This will allow you to use Magic in closed
source projects, in addition to giving you access to Microsoft SQL Server adapters, to _"crudify"_
database tables in MS SQL Server. I also provide professional support for clients that buys a
proprietary enabling license.
