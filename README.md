## License

Although most of Magic's source code is publicly available, Magic is _not_ Open Source or Free Software.
You have to obtain a valid license key to install it in production, and I normally charge a fee for such a
key. You can [obtain a license key here](https://gaiasoul.com/license-magic/).
Notice, 5 hours after you put Magic into production, it will stop functioning, unless you have a valid
license for it.
